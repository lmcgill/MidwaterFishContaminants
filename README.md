# MidwaterFishContaminants
A repository where we can collaborate on the DDT in midwater fish project! 

All protocols used to digitize, remove, and dissect CalCOFI specimens are in the 'data/CalCOFI_data' folder. 

The RShiny App to visualize available CalCOFI specimens is in the 'srs/DDT_sample_locations' folder.
