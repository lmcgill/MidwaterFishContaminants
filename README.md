# MidwaterFishContaminants
A repository where we can collaborate on the DDT in midwater fish project! 

All protocols used to digitize, remove, and dissect CalCOFI specimens are in the 'notes' folder. This folder also includes a description of the various files in the CalCOFI folder to avoid any confusion. 

The RShiny App to visualize available CalCOFI specimens is in the 'srs/DDT_sample_locations' folder.
