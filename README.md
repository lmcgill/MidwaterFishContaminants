# MidwaterFishContaminants
A repository where we can collaborate on the DDT in midwater fish project! 

All protocols used to digitize, remove, and dissect CalCOFI specimens are in the 'data/CalCOFI_data' folder. 

In the 'data/CalCOFI_data' folder the file 'removed_samples' inclues specimens that are included in our analysis. The file 'cannot_locate_samples' includes specimens that were searched for in the CalCOFI collection, but could not be located. In the "notes" section of this, there will be a comment as to whether any record of the specimen removal exists, or if it simply couldn't be located in the physical collection. 

The RShiny App to visualize available CalCOFI specimens is in the 'srs/DDT_sample_locations' folder.
