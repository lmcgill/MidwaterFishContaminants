# CalOFI Protocols and Files 
**Lily McGill**

## Protocols 

This document is just a place to reference the various protocols used for the myctophid contaminant analysis. 

To digitize juvenile information from CalCOFI Fish ID Sheets use [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z1YX9ySY25lU8u7LERHS-nlZGlfdqglIuVJn-eH_y9k/edit). 

To pull CalCOFI samples from the SWFSC use [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eKLhETWGx57hrSWrehXF9zp28PQm1GR-SPMZXw3gkOs/edit). 

To dissect CalCOFI samples in the Semmens lab use [this protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1877mXWwdw-3MGcmEje9qjNW2nZt7MM6QnigPaOG1GAw/edit). 

## File description  

In the 'data/CalCOFI_data/raw_data' folder the *FishCounts_NEW.csv* and *FishSizes_NEW.csv* files contain all counts and sizes of juveniles in the NOAA Juvenile database that Lily and Lucy updated in 2023. This should be all of the available, recorded juveniles and adults from sorted Manta and Bongo tows in the CalCOFI collection. The *unmeasured_approx_sizes.csv* file contains approximate sizes (larval, small, medium, and large) for all Stenobrachius leucopsarus and Triphortorus mexicanus in the collection that were recorded in the FishCounts database, but did not have a corresponding entry in the FishSizes database. 

In the 'data/CalCOFI_data' folder the file *removed_samples.csv* contains specimens that are included in our analysis. The file *cannot_locate_samples.csv* includes specimens that were searched for in the CalCOFI collection, but could not be located. In the "notes" section of this, there will be a comment as to whether any record of the specimen removal exists, or if it simply couldn't be located in the physical collection. The file *FishSizes.csv* contains the same information as *FishSizes_NEW.csv*, but now includes information for specimens from the *unmeasured_approx_sizes.csv* file. This is what we are generally working with to find samples and develop DDT pools. 

The final file, *myctophid_samples_19Oct2023.csv* contains all measured data (e.g., physical measurements, stable isotope IDs and information, DDT pool numbers, etc.) for myctophids that have been processed. The date is not accurate and might be updated as I move along FYI.
